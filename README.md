# MQTTSX
MQTT-SX is an MQTT client tool which is aimed to be simple and easy for developers. I intend to develop this tool further to make the life of Developers easier by providing a free and easy tool but most importantly a secure tool which can be trusted. The tool doesn't capture any details of the broker connection and hence is very secure to be use.

**Please use Java 23.0 for this tool**

Download MQTT-SX-1.0.jar file to your desktop (support on Windows, Linux and Mac) and double click the jar file. Ensure that you have Java 24.0.1 installed (It may work on other java versions but I have verified it on 24.0.1)

Fill up the information of your Mosquitto broker as shown in picture below. Choose SSL if your broker has SSL connection support.

Click on "connect" to connect to broker. If the broker connection is successful then you shall be able to see Publish and Subscribe windows open.

This is the first version of the tool and hence it may have bugs or issues, I request to inform me about bugs and issues so I can improve this tool.
If you any specific feature to be added, kindly leave them in a comment, I'd try my level best to resolve and include it in the next release.
Currently the MQTT-TX supports saving of only one configuration. Stay tuned for more exciting updates.
