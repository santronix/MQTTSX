# MQTTSX
MQTT-SX is an MQTT client tool which is aimed to be simple and easy for developers. I intend to develop this tool further to make the life of Developers easier by providing a free and easy tool but most importantly a secure tool which can be trusted. The tool doesn't capture any details of the broker connection and hence is very secure to be use.

This is the first version of the tool and hence it may have bugs or issues, I request to inform me about bugs and issues so I can improve this tool.
If you any specific feature to be added, kindly leave them in a comment, I'd try my level best to resolve and include it in the next release.
Currently the MQTT-TX supports saving of only one configuration. Stay tuned for more exciting updates.
